Hello, I have reviewed your code, and I have found several areas that can be optimized. I have already made some suggestions, but these optimizations can be time-consuming. Therefore, I am sending you a list of points to consider.

1-We can send email notifications using queue and caching instead of runtime.
2-We can create separate service classes for our business logic, where we can write our code in a way that promotes code reuse and cleanliness.
3-We have used cURL to interact with third-party APIs in this code. However, we can also utilize Laravel's built-in packages to make these API calls.
4-It is possible to simplify the code by reducing the number of unnecessary conditions and optimizing the logic.
5-we can create a separate class to handle Pusher notifications. By encapsulating the Pusher functionality in a dedicated class, you can improve code organization and maintainability.


Sorry Due to a shortage of time, I couldn't optimize the code further. However, if you interview me, you will be able to assess my abilities and skills.

I am a senior PHP Laravel developer and have worked on multiple projects & projects.
